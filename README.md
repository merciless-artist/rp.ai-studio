This is my personal project - a character bot creator that is set up to be decentralized, does not retain any data, no username, no password, no cookies, nothing is kept, it is all private and yours. The bots it creates are Discord Roleplay characters, and their json is compatible with Silly Tavern.

It's a tool, not a polished enterprise platform. There is a community space for questions and beta testing, but understand this is a blueprint for you to embark on your own journey, not a corporate service.

What Makes This Unique:
🔹100% FREE forever
🔹Open for community research and input
🔹Modifiable bot code under NC-BY-CC license
🔹ZERO user data collection
🔹Prioritizes your privacy and creative freedom
🔹Silly tavern compatible character.json
The Only Promises:
🔹Will always be FREE
🔹Transparency in development
🔹Never saves your data

This is a tool that belongs to the community, designed to give you control with zero data retention.

Community Guidelines:
🔹Contributions welcome, encouraged!
🔹Modify the code as you need, share with the community is even better!
🔹Help this bot builder improve as a community
🔹Be a responsible bot builder! The bots that are created by this tool are not meant for anyone under 18!
